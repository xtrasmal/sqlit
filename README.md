## Motivation

Throughout my career, the undesputed truth was that heavy GUI's like SSMS was the only respectable way to access a database. It didn't matter that I wasn't a DBA, or that I didn't need complex performance graphs. I was expected to install a gigabyte-heavy behemoth that took ages to launch all for the mere purpose of running a few queries to update and view a couple of rows.

When I switched to Linux, I was suddenly unable to return to the devil I know, and I asked myself: _how do I access my data now?_

The popular answer was VS Code's SQL extension. But why should we developers launch a heavy Electron app designed for coding just to execute SQL?

I had recently grown fond of Terminal UI's for their speed and keybinding focus. I looked for SQL TUIs, but the options were sparse. The ones I found lacked the user-friendliness and immediate "pick-up-and-go" nature of tools I loved, like lazygit, and I shortly returning to vscode sql extension.

Something wasn't right. I asked myself, why is it that running SQL queries can't be enjoyable? So I created sqlit.

sqlit is for the developer who just wants to query their database with a user friendly UI without their RAM being eaten alive. It is a lightweight, beautiful, and keyboard-driven TUI designed to make accessing your data enjoyable, fast and easy like it should be-- all from inside your favorite terminal.

## Installation

| Method | Command |
| :----- | :------ |
| pipx *(recommended)* | `pipx install sqlit-tui` |
| uv | `uv tool install sqlit-tui` |
| pip | `pip install sqlit-tui` |

## Usage

```bash
sqlit
```

The keybindings are shown at the bottom of the screen.

### Try it without a database

Want to explore the UI without connecting to a real database? Run with mock data:

```bash
sqlit --mock=sqlite-demo
```

### CLI

```bash
# Run a query
sqlit query -c "MyConnection" -q "SELECT * FROM Users"

# Output as CSV or JSON
sqlit query -c "MyConnection" -q "SELECT * FROM Users" --format csv
sqlit query -c "MyConnection" -f "script.sql" --format json

# Create connections for different databases
sqlit connections add mssql --name "MySqlServer" --server "localhost" --auth-type sql
sqlit connections add postgresql --name "MyPostgres" --server "localhost" --username "user" --password "pass"
sqlit connections add mysql --name "MyMySQL" --server "localhost" --username "user" --password "pass"
sqlit connections add cockroachdb --name "MyCockroach" --server "localhost" --port "26257" --database "defaultdb" --username "root"
sqlit connections add sqlite --name "MyLocalDB" --file-path "/path/to/database.db"
sqlit connections add turso --name "MyTurso" --server "libsql://your-db.turso.io" --password "your-auth-token"
sqlit connections add firebird --name "MyFirebird" --server "localhost" --username "user" --password "pass" --database "employee"
sqlit connections add athena --name "MyAthena" --athena-region-name "us-east-1" --athena-s3-staging-dir "s3://my-bucket/results/" --athena-auth-method "profile" --athena-profile-name "default"
sqlit connections add athena --name "MyAthenaKeys" --athena-region-name "us-east-1" --athena-s3-staging-dir "s3://my-bucket/results/" --athena-auth-method "keys" --username "ACCESS_KEY" --password "SECRET_KEY"

# Connect via SSH tunnel
sqlit connections add postgresql --name "RemoteDB" --server "db-host" --username "dbuser" --password "dbpass" \
  --ssh-enabled --ssh-host "ssh.example.com" --ssh-username "sshuser" --ssh-auth-type password --ssh-password "sshpass"

# Temporary (not saved) connection
sqlit connect sqlite --file-path "/path/to/database.db"

# Connect via URL - scheme determines database type (postgresql://, mysql://, sqlite://, etc.)
sqlit postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb
sqlit mysql://root@localhost/testdb
sqlit sqlite:///path/to/database.db

# Save a connection via URL
sqlit connections add --url dbtype://user:pass@host/db --name "MyDB"

# Provider-specific CLI help

## Configuration

Connections and settings are stored in `~/.sqlit/`.

## FAQ

### How are sensitive credentials stored?

Connection details are stored in `~/.sqlit/connections.json`, but passwords are stored in your OS keyring when available (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Locker, Linux Secret Service).

### How does sqlit compare to Harlequin, Lazysql, etc.?

sqlit is inspired by [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - you can just jump in and there's no need for external documentation. The keybindings are shown at the bottom of the screen and the UI is designed to be intuitive without memorizing shortcuts.

Key differences:
- **No need for external documentation** - Sqlit embrace the "lazy" approach in that a user should be able to jump in and use it right away intuitively. There should be no setup instructions. If python packages are required for certain adapters, sqlit will help you install them as you need them.
- **No CLI config required** - Just run `sqlit` and pick a connection from the UI
- **Lightweight** - While Lazysql or Harlequin offer more features, I experienced that for the vast majority of cases, all I needed was a simple and fast way to connect and run queries. Sqlit is focused on doing a limited amount of things really well.

## Inspiration

sqlit is built with [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) and inspired by:
- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - Simple  TUI for git
- [lazysql](https://github.com/jorgerojas26/lazysql) - Terminal-based SQL client with connection manager

### Driver Reference

Most of the time you can just run `sqlit` and connect. If a Python driver is missing, `sqlit` will show (and often run) the right install command for your environment.

| Database                            | Driver package               | `pipx`                                             | `pip` / venv                                       |

### SSH Tunnel Support

SSH tunnel functionality requires additional dependencies. Install with the `ssh` extra:

| Method | Command                            |
| :----- | :--------------------------------- |
| pipx   | `pipx install 'sqlit-tui[ssh]'`    |
| uv     | `uv tool install 'sqlit-tui[ssh]'` |
| pip    | `pip install 'sqlit-tui[ssh]'`     |

If you try to create an SSH connection without these dependencies, sqlit will detect this and show you the exact command to install them for your environment.
