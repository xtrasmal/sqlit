## Motivation
I usually do my work in the terminal, but I found myself either having to boot up massively bloated GUI's like SSMS or Vscode for the simple task of merely browsing my databases and doing some queries toward them. For the vast majority of my use cases, I never used any of the advanced features for inspection and debugging that SSMS and other feature-rich clients provide.

I had the unfortunate situation where doing queries became a pain-point due to the massive operation it is to open SSMS and it's lack of intuitive keyboard only navigation.

The problem got severely worse when I switched to Linux and had to rely on VS CODE's SQL extension to access my database. Something was not right.

I tried to use some existing TUI's for SQL, but they were not intuitive for me and I missed the immediate ease of use that other TUI's such as Lazygit provides.

sqlit is a lightweight database TUI that is easy to use and beautiful to look at, just connect and query. It's for you that just wants to run queries toward your database without launching applications that eats your ram and takes time to load up. Sqlit supports SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MariaDB, FirebirdSQL, Oracle, DuckDB, CockroachDB, ClickHouse, Supabase, and Turso, and is designed to make it easy and enjoyable to access your data, not painful.


## Installation

### Method 1: `pipx` (Recommended)
```bash
pipx install sqlit-tui
```

### Method 2: `uv`

```bash
uv tool install sqlit-tui
```

### Method 3: `pip`

```bash
pip install "sqlit-tui"
```

## Usage

```bash
sqlit
```

The keybindings are shown at the bottom of the screen.

### Try it without a database

Want to explore the UI without connecting to a real database? Run with mock data:

```bash
sqlit --mock=sqlite-demo
```

### CLI

```bash
# Run a query
sqlit query -c "MyConnection" -q "SELECT * FROM Users"

# Output as CSV or JSON
sqlit query -c "MyConnection" -q "SELECT * FROM Users" --format csv
sqlit query -c "MyConnection" -f "script.sql" --format json

# Create connections for different databases
sqlit connections add mssql --name "MySqlServer" --server "localhost" --auth-type sql
sqlit connections add postgresql --name "MyPostgres" --server "localhost" --username "user" --password "pass"
sqlit connections add mysql --name "MyMySQL" --server "localhost" --username "user" --password "pass"
sqlit connections add cockroachdb --name "MyCockroach" --server "localhost" --port "26257" --database "defaultdb" --username "root"
sqlit connections add sqlite --name "MyLocalDB" --file-path "/path/to/database.db"
sqlit connections add turso --name "MyTurso" --server "libsql://your-db.turso.io" --password "your-auth-token"
sqlit connections add firebird --name "MyFirebird" --server "localhost" --username "user" --password "pass" --database "employee"

# Connect via SSH tunnel
sqlit connections add postgresql --name "RemoteDB" --server "db-host" --username "dbuser" --password "dbpass" \
  --ssh-enabled --ssh-host "ssh.example.com" --ssh-username "sshuser" --ssh-auth-type password --ssh-password "sshpass"

# Temporary (not saved) connection
sqlit connect sqlite --file-path "/path/to/database.db"

# Connect via URL - scheme determines database type (postgresql://, mysql://, sqlite://, etc.)
sqlit postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb
sqlit mysql://root@localhost/testdb
sqlit sqlite:///path/to/database.db

# Save a connection via URL
sqlit connections add --url dbtype://user:pass@host/db --name "MyDB"

# Provider-specific CLI help
sqlit connect -h
sqlit connect supabase -h
sqlit connections add -h
sqlit connections add supabase -h

# Manage connections
sqlit connections list
sqlit connections delete "MyConnection"
```

## Keybindings

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `i` | Enter INSERT mode |
| `Esc` | Back to NORMAL mode |
| `e` / `q` / `r` | Focus Explorer / Query / Results |
| `s` | SELECT TOP 100 from table |
| `h` | Query history |
| `d` | Clear query |
| `n` | New query (clear all) |
| `y` | Copy query (when query editor is focused) |
| `v` / `y` / `Y` / `a` | View cell / Copy cell / Copy row / Copy all |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit |
| `?` | Help |

### Commands Menu (`<space>`)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `<space>c` | Connect to database |
| `<space>x` | Disconnect |
| `<space>z` | Cancel running query |
| `<space>e` | Toggle Explorer |

Autocomplete triggers automatically in INSERT mode. Use `Tab` to accept.

You can also receive autocompletion on columns by typing the table name and hitting "."

## Configuration

Connections and settings are stored in `~/.sqlit/`.

## FAQ

### How are sensitive credentials stored?

Connection details are stored in `~/.sqlit/connections.json`, but passwords are stored in your OS keyring when available (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Locker, Linux Secret Service).

If a keyring backend isn't available, `sqlit` will ask whether to store passwords as plaintext in `~/.sqlit/` (protected permissions). If you decline, you’ll be prompted when needed.

### How does sqlit compare to Harlequin, Lazysql, etc.?

sqlit is inspired by [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - you can just jump in and there's no need for external documentation. The keybindings are shown at the bottom of the screen and the UI is designed to be intuitive without memorizing shortcuts.

Key differences:
- **No need for external documentation** - Sqlit embrace the "lazy" approach in that a user should be able to jump in and use it right away intuitively. There should be no setup instructions. If python packages are required for certain adapters, sqlit will help you install them as you need them.
- **No CLI config required** - Just run `sqlit` and pick a connection from the UI
- **Lightweight** - While Lazysql or Harlequin offer more features, I experienced that for the vast majority of cases, all I needed was a simple and fast way to connect and run queries. Sqlit is focused on doing a limited amount of things really well.

## Inspiration

sqlit is built with [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual) and inspired by:
- [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - Simple  TUI for git
- [lazysql](https://github.com/jorgerojas26/lazysql) - Terminal-based SQL client with connection manager

### Driver Reference

Most of the time you can just run `sqlit` and connect. If a Python driver is missing, `sqlit` will show (and often run) the right install command for your environment.

| Database | Driver package | `pipx` | `pip` / venv |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SQLite | *(built-in)* | *(built-in)* | *(built-in)* |
| PostgreSQL / CockroachDB / Supabase | `psycopg2-binary` | `pipx inject sqlit-tui psycopg2-binary` | `python -m pip install psycopg2-binary` |
| SQL Server | `pyodbc` | `pipx inject sqlit-tui pyodbc` | `python -m pip install pyodbc` |
| MySQL | `mysql-connector-python` | `pipx inject sqlit-tui mysql-connector-python` | `python -m pip install mysql-connector-python` |
| MariaDB | `mariadb` | `pipx inject sqlit-tui mariadb` | `python -m pip install mariadb` |
| Oracle | `oracledb` | `pipx inject sqlit-tui oracledb` | `python -m pip install oracledb` |
| DuckDB | `duckdb` | `pipx inject sqlit-tui duckdb` | `python -m pip install duckdb` |
| ClickHouse | `clickhouse-connect` | `pipx inject sqlit-tui clickhouse-connect` | `python -m pip install clickhouse-connect` |
| Turso | `libsql-client` | `pipx inject sqlit-tui libsql-client` | `python -m pip install libsql-client` |
| Cloudflare D1 | `requests` | `pipx inject sqlit-tui requests` | `python -m pip install requests` |
| Firebird | `firebirdsql` | `pip install firebirdsql` | `python -m pip install firebirdsql` |

**Note:** SQL Server also requires the platform-specific ODBC driver. On your first connection attempt, `sqlit` can help you install it if it's missing.

### SSH Tunnel Support

SSH tunnel functionality requires additional dependencies. Install with the `ssh` extra:

| Method | Command |
| :--- | :--- |
| pipx | `pipx install 'sqlit-tui[ssh]'` |
| uv | `uv tool install 'sqlit-tui[ssh]'` |
| pip | `pip install 'sqlit-tui[ssh]'` |

If you try to create an SSH connection without these dependencies, sqlit will detect this and show you the exact command to install them for your environment.
